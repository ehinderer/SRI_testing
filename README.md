# SRI Testing

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repository contains a compendium of semantics-driven tests for assessing Translator Knowledge Providers (KPs) and Autonomous Relay Agents (ARAs) within the [Biomedical Data Translator](https://ncats.nih.gov/translator).

# Contents of the Repository

The project has two top level folders:

- Modules under [translator](translator) package, containing code shared between all categories of tests, including some generic TRAPI and Translator Status Dashboard scripts.
- Modules of the actual (Py)test harness under [tests](tests). At the moment, only one category of Translator of testing is implemented, that is, [One Hop Tests](tests/onehop/README.md).  Note that to run these tests, [KPs and ARAs need to configure web visible test data](tests/onehop/README.md#configuring-the-tests).

# Getting Started

The tests are recommended to be run using Python 3.9 or better. 

If not running inside a Docker container, the creation of a virtual environment is recommended.

## Python Dependencies

From within your virtual environment, install the indicated Python dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file:

```shell
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt  # or equivalent command
```

## Run the Tests

Simply run available [tests](tests) using Pytest, within your favorite modality (i.e. terminal, favorite IDE, etc.).

# SRI Testing as a Web Service

The SRI Testing Harness may be run as a Web Service. See [here](api/README.md) for more details.

# TRAPI Validation Dashboard

A nice web interface is available to browse through results of SRI Testing Harness test runs.  [Documentation about this web interface](dashboard/README.md) is available. The interface may also be deployed as a Docker container (see below).

# Running the System within Docker

The SRI Testing system may also be run within Docker containers, using Docker Compose.

Assuming that you have installed both [Docker (or rather, Docker Desktop)](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (Note: Docker Desktop now conveniently installs both...), then the following steps can be followed to run the system.

## Pre-Configuration

Two Dockerfile templates are available: [Dockerfile_RENCI_PRODUCTION](Dockerfile_RENCI_PRODUCTION) and [Dockerfile_SIMPLE](Dockerfile_SIMPLE). If you simply want to run the system locally, the SIMPLE dockerfile may do. A more robust Dockerfile configuration file - the RENCI variant - is more optimized for Kubernetes deployment in an institutional setting (like RENCI!).  Copy one or the other file into a single file named "Dockerfile" then continue with the instructions below.

The SRI Testing Dashboard also relies on some site specific parameters - encoded in a **.env** environmental variable configuration file -to work properly.  The **.env** file is **.gitignored** in the repo. A template file, [dot_env_template](dashboard/dot_env_template) is provided. A copy of this file should be made into a file called **.env** and customized to site requirements (see [full details here](dashboard/README.md)).

## Database for the Test Results

You will generally want to have the backend persist its test results in a MongoDb database(*), so first start up a Mongo instance as so:

```shell
docker-compose -f run-mongodb.yaml up -d
```

Note that the application will default to use the filing system for its test run under a local **results** directory, if the MongoDb container is not running.  The application will start a bit more slowly in such a situation as it awaits the timeout of the attempted connection to a MongoDb database.

If the database is running, the Mongo-Express container may be run to look at it:

```shell
docker-compose -f run-mongodb-monitor.yaml up -d
```

Mongo-Express web page is available at http://localhost:8081.  It is generally not a good idea to run this on a production server.

## Testing Engine and Web Dashboard

Next, build then start up the services consisting of Docker containers for the testing dashboard and backend engine - defined in the default _Dockerfile_ - using **Docker Compose**, by the root directory of the project, build the local docker container

```shell
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

Once again, go to  http://localhost/docs to see the service documentation.  Docker logs may be viewed in a streaming fashion by:

```shell
docker-compose logs -f
```

To stop the Docker containers:

```shell
docker-compose down
docker-compose -f run-mongodb.yaml down
```

Of course, the above `docker-compose` commands may be overridden by the user to suit their needs. Note that the docker implementation assumes the use of uvicorn (installed as a dependency).
